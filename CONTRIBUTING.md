# CONTRIBUTING

We welcome ideas, bug reports, opinions and pull requests. Telling the maintainers
why you want or have done something is always very helpful.

## Branch naming conventions

In general `type/brief-description-of-branch`, example: `pattern/advanced-search`,
or `fix/grid-breaks-on-ios`

Here are the most common `type`s:

- `patterns/` when developing a new pattern;
- `feature/` to be used when working on something that affects the whole system;
- `fix/` to be used for ... fixes;
- `hot-fix/` something very specific and usually urgent; and
- `docs/` for anything to do with documentation, content or code.

## Code styling

See the [docs/guidelines](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/tree/develop/docs/guidelines)
for tips on naming contentions and styles.

If you're committing code or pull requests, note we use [Husky}(https://github.com/typicode/husky#husky)
as a pre-commit hook to help enforce Sass linting. 

## Code of Conduct

We don't have a full policy yet but, in general: be nice, respectful
and considerate. The maintainers will do the same.
