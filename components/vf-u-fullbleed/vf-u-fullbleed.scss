// **Thinking about deleting this file?**
// If your component needs no CSS/Sass, we still recommend leaving the
// scss files in place. As this is primarily a CSS framework, it is better to
// leave the empty files so you know a file wasn't accidently omitted.
// If you don't have any Sass, you can trim this block down to:
// "This page was intentionally left blank"

@import 'package.variables.scss';
// Debug information from component's `package.json`:

/*
 * 1. position: relative is needed for the pseudo element.
 * 2. make the background colour inherit from classanmes in use.
 * 3. make the pseudo element 100% of the element so we can see it.
 * 4. push the pseudo element away from the left of the viewport.
 * 5. If the component has vertical padding we need to make sure the pseudo element
 *    is set to the top of the containing box.
 * 6. make the pseudo element full-width.
 * 7. put the pseudo element 'underneath' the element so it doesn't block.
