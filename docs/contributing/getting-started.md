There's no need to download or clone the `vf-core` repository, instead you can use
its components to enhance or build your design system:

- Use the [Visual Framework child theme](https://github.com/khawkins98/vf-child-playground) as a boilerplate
- [Install a specific component from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/visual-framework)

If those don't cover your use case, and you just need some CSS and JS to plug-in to
your website, [let us know](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core/issues/new/choose).
