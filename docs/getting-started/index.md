<a id="get-started"></a>Here are ways to utilise the Visual Framework:

1. 🛍 [Browse the online patterns](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core)
1. 🏎 Utilise the whole, unaltered Framework: include the [CSS, JS and copy a boilerplate](https://visual-framework.github.io/vf-core/components/render/vf-boilerplate-page)
1. 🚰 [Install a specific pattern from npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/visual-framework) and include the Sass/JS
1. 🏗 Get a custom look and patterns with [your own Visual Framework child theme](https://github.com/khawkins98/vf-child-playground)

([This is pulled from the README.md](https://github.com/visual-framework/vf-core#-get-started))
