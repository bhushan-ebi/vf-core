# Setting Up

To develop the Visual Framework your will need some software.

## Development environment

If you don't already have a code editor and are new to git, a good starting point is to:

1. [Setup a GitHub.com account](https://github.com/join)
1. Install the [GitHub Desktop git client](https://desktop.github.com/)
1. For editing code, [install Atom](https://atom.io/)

## Development tools

First, see if you have the needed tools installed.

1. Open a command line/terminal
1. Enter `node -v`
1. Enter `gulp -v`

If either of those steps return an error you need to install the corresponding
software.

- To install Node: go to the official [downloads page](https://nodejs.org/download/)
- To install Gulp: Gulp requires Node and can be installed by: `npm install gulpjs/gulp-cli -g`
